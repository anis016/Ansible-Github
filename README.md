This repository is about creating Ansible Modules that can `create` or `delete` a repository on github.

Ansible modules are the building blocks for building ansible playbooks. They are small pieces of python code that can be triggered from the `yaml` in a playbook.

Majority of the work is based on https://blog.toast38coza.me/custom-ansible-module-hello-world/
